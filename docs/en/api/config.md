# Config

vue-test-utils includes a config object to defined options used by vue-test-utils.

## `vue-test-utils` Config Options

### `stubs`

- type: `Object`
- default: `{
  transition: TransitionStub,
  'transition-group': TransitionGroupStub
}`

The stub stored in `config.stubs` is used by default.  
Stubs to use in components. These are overwritten by `stubs` passed in the mounting options.

When passing `stubs` as an array in the mounting options, `config.stubs` are converted to an array, and will stub components with a basic component that returns `<!---->`.

Example:

```js
import VueTestUtils from 'vue-test-utils'

VueTestUtils.config.stubs['my-compomnent'] = '<div />'
```
