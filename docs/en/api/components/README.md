# Components

Vue Test Utils includes utility components you can use to stub components.

[TransitionStub](./TransitionStub.md) and [TransitionGroupStub](./TransitionGroupStub.md) are used to stub `transition` and `transition-group` components by default. You can edit the stubs by editing the config.
