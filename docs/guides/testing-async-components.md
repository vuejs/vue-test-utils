## Testing Asynchronous Behavior

To simplify testing, Vue Test Utils applies DOM updates _synchronously_. However, there are some techniques you need to be aware of when testing a component with asynchronous behavior such as callbacks or promises.

One of the most common asynchronous behaviors is API calls and Vuex actions. The following examples shows how to test a method that makes an API call. This example uses Jest to run the test and to mock the HTTP library `axios`. More about Jest manual mocks can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/manual-mocks.html#content).

The implementation of the `axios` mock looks like this:

```js
export default {
  get: () => Promise.resolve({ data: 'value' })
}
```

The below component makes an API call when a button is clicked, then assigns the response to `value`.

```html
<template>
  <button @click="fetchResults" />
</template>

<script>
  import axios from 'axios'

  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        value: null
      }
    },

    methods: {
      async fetchResults() {
        const response = await axios.get('mock/service')
        this.value = response.data
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

A test can be written like this:

```js
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Foo from './Foo'
jest.mock('axios')

it('fetches async when a button is clicked', () => {
  const wrapper = shallowMount(Foo)
  wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')
  expect(wrapper.vm.value).toBe('value')
})
```

This test currently fails because the assertion is called before the promise in `fetchResults` resolves. Most unit test libraries provide a callback to let the runner know when the test is complete. Jest and Mocha both use `done`. We can use `done` in combination with `$nextTick` or `setTimeout` to ensure any promises resolve before the assertion is made.

```js
it('fetches async when a button is clicked', done => {
  const wrapper = shallowMount(Foo)
  wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')
  wrapper.vm.$nextTick(() => {
    expect(wrapper.vm.value).toBe('value')
    done()
  })
})
```

The reason `$nextTick` or `setTimeout` allow the test to pass is because the microtask queue where promise callbacks are processed run before the task queue, where `$nextTick` and `setTimeout` are processed. This means by the time the `$nextTick` and `setTimeout` run, any promise callbacks on the microtask queue will have been executed. See [here](https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules/) for a more detailed explanation.

Another solution is to use an `async` function and the npm package `flush-promises`. `flush-promises` flushes all pending resolved promise handlers. You can `await` the call of `flushPromises` to flush pending promises and improve the readability of your test.

The updated test looks like this:

```js
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import flushPromises from 'flush-promises'
import Foo from './Foo'
jest.mock('axios')

it('fetches async when a button is clicked', async () => {
  const wrapper = shallowMount(Foo)
  wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')
  await flushPromises()
  expect(wrapper.vm.value).toBe('value')
})
```

This same technique can be applied to Vuex actions, which return a promise by default.
